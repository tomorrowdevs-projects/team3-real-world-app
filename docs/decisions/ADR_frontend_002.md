## Context and Problem Statement

Which is the best way to develop the web app's frontend? Is better to use a library, a framework, or to use pure language?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* collaborators experiences
* easy to learn
* validate knowledge

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Vanilla Javascript", because we decided to use the project as an exercise for all the team's members.

* To validate the knowledge about Javascript

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Spend more time to define interactions between HTML and JS than with React and Next.js
* Not having access to the optimizations provided by React and Next.js  

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Vanilla Javascript

* Good, beacuse it is easy to learn
* Good knowledge of the members who will develop the frontend

### React

* Good, because it uses components
* Good, because the components are reusable
* Bad, because it takes time to learn
* Bad, because it is overcomplicated for the size of the project

### Next.js

* Good, because it is the react framework, it is react with the all features for production, server rendering, routing...
* Good, because it improves the efficiency of the application
* Bad, because it takes time to learn
